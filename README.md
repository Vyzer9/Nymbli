## 🎯 About Nymbli
**Nymbli** is an open-source programming language created in August 2025, built using **Racket** and **Elixir**.  
It is an **interpreted**, **imperative** language that features a **functional-style syntax**, including **Polish notation** and a concise, agile syntax design.

## 🌐 WebSite
The site is currently under maintenance. It will be available soon.

## 🧰 Technologies
The Nymbli language was originally prototyped in **Haskell**, but later rewritten in **Racket**.  
**Elixir** was used during testing and for some experimental components, which may not be part of the final codebase.
The website is built using modern web technologies including **TypeScript**, **Vite**, **React**, and **WebAssembly**, among others.
