## 🎯 About Nymbli
**Nymbli** is an open-source programming language created in August 2025, built using **Racket** and **Elixir**.  
It is an **interpreted**, **imperative** language that features a **functional-style syntax**, including **Polish notation** and a concise, agile syntax design.

## 🌐 WebSite
The site is currently under maintenance. It will be available soon.

---

## 🧰 Technologies
**The Nymbli language** was originally prototyped in **Haskell**, but later rewritten in **Racket**.  
**Elixir** was used during testing and for some experimental components, which may not be part of the final codebase.

## 🏗️ Features and Architecture

Nymbli is a modern language designed with a focus on agility, syntactic simplicity, and structural clarity. Its architecture is built to be extensible and adaptable, offering a solid functional foundation with the flexibility to evolve into a multi-paradigm language.

- 🛠️ **Interpreted and Agile**  
  Nymbli is an **interpreted** language, allowing for fast development cycles and instant feedback. It's ideal for prototyping, scripting, and interactive workflows.

- 🔣 **Polish Notation (Prefix Syntax)**  
  The language uses **Polish notation**, like `(+ 1 2)`, which removes syntactic ambiguity and simplifies parsing — making it easy for both machines and humans to read.

- ⚙️ **Imperative with Functional Roots**  
  The current core of the language is **functional**, promoting pure functions and immutability. However, **imperative features** are already supported, and there are plans to evolve into a **multi-paradigm** language to support various programming styles.

- 🚀 **Productivity-Oriented**  
  Nymbli's syntax is **concise**, **expressive**, and designed for readability. The language avoids unnecessary noise and promotes a clean, fluent coding experience.

- 🔧 **Modular Design**  
  The language architecture is built to support new features without breaking existing ones, making the interpreter/compiler easy to maintain and extend.
