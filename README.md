## 🎯 About Nymbli
**Nymbli** is an open-source programming language created in August 2025, built using **Racket** and **Elixir**.  
It is an **interpreted**, **imperative** language that features a **functional-style syntax**, including **Polish notation** and a concise, agile syntax design.

## 🌐 WebSite
The site is currently under maintenance. It will be available soon.

## 🧰 Technologies
**The Nymbli language** was originally prototyped in **Haskell**, but later rewritten in **Racket**.  
**Elixir** was used during testing and for some experimental components, which may not be part of the final codebase.

**The website** is built using modern web technologies including **TypeScript**, **Vite**, **React**, and **WebAssembly**, among others.

## 🏗️ Features and Architecture

Nymbli is a modern language designed with a focus on agility, syntactic simplicity, and structural clarity. Its architecture is built to be extensible and adaptable, offering a solid functional foundation with the flexibility to evolve into a multi-paradigm language.

- 🛠️ **Interpreted and Agile**  
  Nymbli is an **interpreted** language, allowing for fast development cycles and instant feedback. It's ideal for prototyping, scripting, and interactive workflows.

- 🔣 **Polish Notation (Prefix Syntax)**  
  The language uses **Polish notation**, like `(+ 1 2)`, which removes syntactic ambiguity and simplifies parsing — making it easy for both machines and humans to read.

- ⚙️ **Imperative with Functional Roots**  
  The current core of the language is **functional**, promoting pure functions and immutability. However, **imperative features** are already supported, and there are plans to evolve into a **multi-paradigm** language to support various programming styles.

- 🚀 **Productivity-Oriented**  
  Nymbli's syntax is **concise**, **expressive**, and designed for readability. The language avoids unnecessary noise and promotes a clean, fluent coding experience.

- 🔧 **Modular Design**  
  The language architecture is built to support new features without breaking existing ones, making the interpreter/compiler easy to maintain and extend.

## ⚙️ Usage Instructions
At the moment 04/09/2025 the Language has basic syntax, 100% pure but it does not yet have the advanced, additional methods, etc. We are in development to deliver the beta version of it with at least the essentials for everyone.
In the meantime, you can give the Fork command, give stars and if you want to report bugs, suggestions and other things that will benefit and grow the language.
